Trying to get python to work in goldencheetah.

- Added python 3.8 because 3.7 did not have sip any more.
- Added 3.8's sip_4 and added the necessary includes.

Building seems to go fine now, no complaints about not finding `*.h` files, buuuuuut

the build fails due to some SIP_MODULE_NAME mentions for which it doesn't know
what they are. The exact same code (presumably) does seem to work in their
travis build, so I guess I am forgetting some configuration setting or maybe
something from SIP usage. Note that their travis script has a python
configure.py, is there a chance that edits python include files and creates the
relevant file for sip stuff which in turn also defines that preprocessor
(presumably) variable?

Find out next time on... compiling goldencheetah!
